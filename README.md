English to Morse Code
---------------------

Type English text in the text area provided. When you press

Morse code and displayed in the text area to the right. Each
English character is separated by white space in morse code
and space between English words is translated as '/' in the
generated morse code.

You can clear the existing morse code in the text area with 
a button at the bottom of the app. 

Type the morse code in the text area to the right. Separate morse code for each letter by a space. '/' denotes
a space between words.
